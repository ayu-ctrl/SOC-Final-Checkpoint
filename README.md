# SOC-Final-Checkpoint
The problem I set out to solve was to understand the core fundamentals of AI/ML â€” and more importantly, how to apply them in small but meaningful real-world projects.

As a beginner, my goal was to explore both the theoretical foundations and practical tools used in AI/ML workflows. I followed a structured 8-week learning path where I covered topics like:

Python programming basics: including variables, loops, functions, and syntax

Data handling using Pandas and NumPy

Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

Supervised and unsupervised machine learning concepts

Classification algorithms like Logistic Regression

Feature Engineering and Time Series Forecasting

Natural Language Processing (NLP) for chatbot development

I also used hands-on tools such as Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, NLTK, and TensorFlow.

By the end of this project, I was able to implement several real-world mini-projects:

A house price prediction model using regression

An Iris dataset classifier using logistic regression

A stock price prediction system using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, which is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

And finally, I was able to built a basic chatbot built with NLP and a simple neural network

These projects helped me bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical machine learning implementation.
